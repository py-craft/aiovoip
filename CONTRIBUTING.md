## Get Started!

aiovoip is using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management.

Assuming you have uv installed, you can get started with the following commands:

```bash
uv sync
```

This will install all the dependencies and set up the project by creating a virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To validate if your environment is set up correctly, then run the unit tests:

```bash
pytest
```
If all tests pass, you are ready to start contributing!
