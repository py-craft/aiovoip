# asipio

asipio is a fork of deprecated [aiosip](https://github.com/Eyepea/aiosip) library, which aims to modernize the codebase, fix existing bugs, and add new features. The goal is to have open-source, maintained, asynchronous python SIP library with a clean and modern codebase.

**Warning: The library is currently in an early stage of development, so please use it at your own risk.**

## Naming and reasons of the fork

Initially, I wanted to name the library asyncsip, but unfortunately, that name was already taken by another project. So, I decided to go with asipio, which is a combination of 'asynchronous', 'SIP' (Session Initiation Protocol), and 'IO' (Input/Output). The name is unique and reflects the purpose of the library; it also sounds a bit like asyncio, which is a nice bonus.
