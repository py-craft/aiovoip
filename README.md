**asipio** is a modern, asynchronous SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) library for Python. It was forked from the deprecated [aiosip](https://github.com/Eyepea/aiosip) project, with the goal of revitalizing and maintaining a clean, bug-fixed, and feature-rich codebase.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This library is in an early stage of development. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- Fully asynchronous SIP implementation
- Clean and modernized codebase
- Ongoing maintenance and feature development
- Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 compatibility

## Python Compatibility

`asipio` is tested and works with:
- Python **3.11**
- Python **3.12**
- Python **3.13**

## Name Rationale

The original name idea was `asyncsip`, but that name was already taken. Thus, the library was named **asipio**, a combination of:
- **a**synchronous
- **SIP** (Session Initiation Protocol)
- **IO** (Input/Output)

The name is unique, descriptive, and it also sounds a bit like `asyncio`, which is a nice bonus.
